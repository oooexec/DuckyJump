# Ducky Jump

It is my second game which I am making in C++ with SFML Framework.

# Building

Linux:

* Make sure that you have sfml libs installed.
* create "build" directory in main folder
* open terminal in "build" directory
* type command "cmake .. && make"
* copy "Graphics" directory to "build" directory
* run the game :)
